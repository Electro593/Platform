# Assembler

An assembler for the instruction set I helped design for my CSSE232 Computer Architecture 1 class.

## Building

Execute the `build.bat` file in the `scripts` folder. Note that this project will only work on Windows. `build.bat` uses the MSVC compiler, so if you have it installed somewhere other than the default location, just update the path in the call line.
